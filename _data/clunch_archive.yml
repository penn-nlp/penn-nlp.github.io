  title: Towards Equitable Language Technologies
  abstract: |
    Language technologies are now ubiquitous. Yet the benefits of these technologies do not accrue evenly to all people, and they can be harmful; they can reproduce stereotypes, prevent speakers of “non-standard” language varieties from participating fully in public discourse, and reinscribe historical patterns of linguistic discrimination. In this talk, I will take a tour through the rapidly emerging body of research examining bias and harm in language technologies and offer some perspective on the many challenges of this work. I will discuss some recent efforts to understand language-related harms in their sociohistorical contexts, and to investigate NLP resources developed for one such harm—stereotyping—touching on the complexities of deciding what these resources ought to measure, and how they ought to measure it.

  title: On the Evaluation and Mitigation of Faithfulness Errors in Abstractive Summarization
  abstract: |
    Despite recent progress in abstractive summarization, systems still generate unfaithful summaries, i.e. summaries that contain information that is not supported by the input. There has been a lot of effort to develop methods to measure and improve faithfulness errors. In this talk, I will first introduce some of the proposed methods to measure faithfulness of summarization systems. Then, I will present a spurious correlate: i.e., extractiveness of the summary, that potentially influences how we should evaluate the faithfulness of these systems. In particular, I will describe our work that proposes a method to measure and improve faithfulness by accounting for the extractiveness of summarization systems. Furthermore, I will discuss the importance of accounting for spurious correlations (such as extractiveness, perplexity, and length) in designing effective evaluation frameworks for text generation.

  title: 'Detecting and Rewriting Socially Biased Language'
  abstract: |
    Language has the power to reinforce stereotypes and project social biases onto others, either through overt hate or subtle biases. Accounting for this toxicity and social bias in language is crucial for natural language processing (NLP) systems to be safely and ethically deployed in the world. In this talk, I will first discuss subjectivity challenges in binary hate speech detection, by examining perceptions of offensiveness of text depending on reader attitudes and identities. Through an online study, we find several correlates between over- or under-detecting text as toxic based on political leaning, attitudes about racism and free speech. Then, as an alternative to binary hate speech detection, I will present Social Bias Frames, a new structured formalism for distilling biased implications of language. Using a new corpus of 150k structured annotations, we show that models can learn to reason about high-level offensiveness of statements, but struggle to explain why a statement might be harmful. Finally, I will introduce PowerTransformer, an unsupervised model for controllable debiasing of text through the lens of connotation frames of power and agency. With this model, we show that subtle gender biases in how characters are portrayed in stories and movies can be mitigated through automatic rewriting. I will conclude with future directions for better reasoning about toxicity and social biases in language.

  title: '"Understanding" and prediction: Controlled examinations of meaning sensitivity in pre-trained models'
  abstract: |
    In recent years, NLP has made what appears to be incredible progress, with performance even surpassing human performance on some benchmarks. How should we interpret these advances? Have these models achieved language "understanding"? Operating on the premise that "understanding" will necessarily involve the capacity to extract and deploy meaning information, in this talk I will discuss a series of projects leveraging targeted tests to examine NLP models' ability to capture meaning in a systematic fashion. I will first discuss work probing model representations for compositional meaning, with a particular focus on disentangling compositional information from encoding of lexical properties. I'll then explore models' ability to extract and deploy meaning information during word prediction, applying tests inspired by psycholinguistics to examine what types of information models encode and access for anticipating words in context. In all cases, these investigations apply tests that prioritize control of unwanted cues, so as to target the desired meaning capabilities with greater precision. The results of these studies suggest that although models show a good deal of sensitivity to word-level information, and to a number of semantic and syntactic distinctions, they show little sign of capturing higher-level compositional meaning, of capturing logical impacts of meaning components like negation, or of retaining access to robust representations of meaning information conveyed in prior context. I will discuss potential implications of these findings with respect to the goals of achieving "understanding" with currently dominant pre-training paradigms.

  title: "Information Surgery: Faking Multimedia Fake News for Real Fake News Detection"
  abstract: |
    We are living in an era of information pollution. The dissemination of falsified information can cause chaos, hatred, and trust issues among humans, and can eventually hinder the development of society. In particular, human-written disinformation, which is often used to manipulate certain populations, had catastrophic impact on multiple events, such as the 2016 US Presidential Election, Brexit, the COVID-19 pandemic, and the recent Russia’s assault on Ukraine. Hence, we are in urgent need of a defending mechanism against human-written disinformation. While there has been a lot of research and many recent advances in neural fake news detection, there are many challenges remaining. In particular, the accuracy of existing techniques at detecting human-written fake news is barely above random. In this talk I will present our recent attempts at tackling four unique challenges in the frontline of combating fake news written by both machines and humans: (1) Define a new task on knowledge element level misinformation detection based on cross-media knowledge extraction and reasoning to make the detector more accurate and explainable; (2) Generate training data for the detector based on knowledge graph manipulation and knowledge graph guided natural language generation; (3) Use Natural Language Inference to ensure the fake information cannot be inferred from the rest of the real document; (4) Propose the first work to generate propaganda for more robust detection of human-written fake news.

  title: "SCROLLS: Standard CompaRison Over Long Language Sequences"
  abstract: |
    NLP benchmarks have largely focused on short texts, such as sentences and paragraphs, even though long texts comprise a considerable amount of natural language in the wild. We introduce SCROLLS, a suite of tasks that require reasoning over long texts. We examine existing long-text datasets, and handpick ones where the text is naturally long, while prioritizing tasks that involve synthesizing information across the input. SCROLLS contains summarization, question answering, and natural language inference tasks, covering multiple domains, including literature, science, business, and entertainment. Initial baselines, including Longformer Encoder-Decoder, indicate that there is ample room for improvement on SCROLLS. We make all datasets available in a unified text-to-text format and host a live leaderboard to facilitate research on model architecture and pretraining methods.

  title: "Manchester vs. Cranfield: Why do we have computers answering questions from web search data and how can we do it better?"
  abstract: |
    In this talk, I'll argue that the intellectual nexus of computers searching through the web to answer questions comes from research undertaken in two mid-century English university towns: Manchester and Cranfield. After reviewing the seminal work of Cyril Cleverdon and Alan Turing and explaining how that shaped today the information and AI age, I'll argue that these represent two competing visions for how computers should answer questions: either exploration of intelligence (Manchester) or serving the user (Cranfield). However, regardless of which paradigm you adhere to, I argue that the ideals for those visions are not fulfilled in modern question answering implementations: the human (Ken Jennings) vs. computer (Watson) competition on Jeopardy! was rigged, other evaluations don't show which system knows more about a topic, the training and evaluation data don't reflect the background of users, and the annotation scheme for training data is incomplete. After outlining our short-term solutions to these issues, I'll then discuss a longer-term plan to achieve the goals of both the Manchester and Cranfield paradigms.

  title: Causal analysis of the syntactic representations used by Transformers
  abstract: |
    The success of artificial neural networks in language processing tasks has underscored the need to understand how they accomplish their behavior, and, in particular, how their internal vector representations support that behavior. The probing paradigm, which has often been invoked to address this question, relies on the (typically implicit) assumption that if a classifier can decode a particular piece of information from the model's intermediate representation, then that information plays a role in shaping the model's behavior. This assumption is not necessarily justified. Using the test case of everyone's favorite syntactic phenomenon - English subject-verb number agreement - I will present an approach that provides much stronger evidence for the *causal* role of the encoding of a particular linguistic feature in the model's behavior. This approach, which we refer to as AlterRep, modifies the internal representation in question such that it encodes the opposite value of that feature; e.g., if BERT originally encoded a particular word as occurring inside a relative clause, we modify the representation to encode that it is not inside the relative clause. I will show that the conclusions of this method diverge from those of the probing method. Finally, if time permits, I will present a method based on causal mediation analysis that makes it possible to draw causal conclusions by applying counterfactual interventions to the *inputs*, contrasting with AlterRep which intervenes on the model's internal representations.

  title: Learning Computational Models of Non-Standard Language
  abstract: |
    Non-standard linguistic items, such as novel words or creative spellings, are common in domains like social media and pose challenges for automatically processing text from these domains. To build models capable of processing such innovative items, we need to not only understand how humans reason about non-standard language, but also be able to operationalize this knowledge to create useful inductive biases. In this talk, I will present empirical studies of several phenomena under the umbrella of non-standard language, modeled at the levels of granularity ranging from individual users to entire dialects. First, I will show how idiosyncratic spelling preferences reveal information about the user, with an application to the bibliographic task of identifying typesetters of historical printed documents. Second, I will discuss the common patterns in user-specific orthographies and demonstrate that incorporating these patterns helps with unsupervised conversion of idiosyncratically romanized text into the native orthography of the language. In the final part of the talk, I will focus on word emergence in a dialect as a whole and present a diachronic corpus study modeling the language-internal and language-external factors that drive neology.

  title: "On the importance of baselines: Communicative efficiency and the statistics of words in natural language"
  abstract: |
    Is language designed for communicative and functional efficiency? G. K. Zipf (1949) famously argued that shorter words are more frequent because they are easier to use, thereby resulting in the statistical law that bears his name. Yet, G. A. Miller (1957) showed that even a monkey randomly typing at a keyboard, and intermittently striking the space bar, would generate “words” with similar statistical properties. Recent quantitative analyses of human language lexicons (Piantadosi et al., 2012) have revived Zipf's functionalist hypothesis. Ambiguous words tend to be short, frequent, and easy to articulate in language production. Such statistical findings are commonly interpreted as evidence for pressure for efficiency, as the context of language use often provides cues to overcome lexical ambiguity. In this talk, I update Miller's monkey thought experiment to incorporate empirically motivated phonological and semantic constraints on the creation of words. I claim that the appearance of communicative efficiency is a spandrel (in the sense of Gould & Lewontin, 1979), as lexicons formed without the context of language use or reference to communication or efficiency exhibit comparable statistical properties. Furthermore, the updated monkey model provides a good fit for the growth trajectory of English as recorded in the Oxford English Dictionary. Focusing on the history of English words since 1900, I show that lexicons resulting from the monkey model provide a better embodiment of communicative efficiency than the actual lexicon of English. I conclude by arguing that the kind of faulty logic underlying the study of communicative efficiency crops up quite commonly within NLP -- evaluation metrics, and appropriate baselines, need to be carefully considered before any claims (cognitive or otherwise) can safely be made on their basis.

  title: Systematic Reasoning and Explanation over Natural Language
  abstract: |
    Recent work has shown that transformers can be trained to reason *systematically* with natural language (NL) statements, answering questions with answers implied by a set of provided facts and rules, and even generating proofs for those conclusions. However, these systems required all the knowledge to be provided explicitly as input. In this talk, I will describe our current work on generalizing this to real NL problems, where the system produces faithful, entailment-based proofs for its answers, including materializing its own latent knowledge as needed for those proofs. The resulting reasoning-supported answers can then be inspected, debugged, and corrected by the user, offering new opportunities for interactive problem-solving dialogs, and taking a step towards "teachable systems" that can learn from such dialogs over time.

  title: "Zero-shot learning and out-of-distribution generalization: two sides of the same coin"
  abstract: |
    Recent advances in large pre-trained language models have shifted the NLP community’s attention to new challenges: (a) training models with zero, or very few, examples, and (b) generalizing to out-of-distribution examples. In this talk, I will argue that the two are intimately related, and describe ongoing (read, new!) work in those directions. First, I will describe a new pre-training scheme for open-domain question answering that is based on the notion of “recurring spans” across different paragraphs. We show this training scheme leads to a zero-shot retriever that is competitive with DPR (which trains on thousands of examples), and is more robust w.r.t the test distribution. Second, I will focus on compositional generalization, a particular type of out-of-distribution generalization setup where models need to generalize to structures that are unobserved at training time. I will show that the view that seq2seq models categorically do not generalize to new compositions is false, and present a more nuanced analysis, which elucidates what are the conditions under which models struggle to compositionally generalize.

  title: Out-of-distribution generalization in NLP
  abstract: |
    Real-world NLP models must work well when the test distribution differs from the training distribution. While we have made great progress in natural language understanding thanks to large-scale pre-training, current models still take shortcuts and rely on spurious correlations in specific datasets. In this talk, I will discuss the role of pre-training and data in model robustness to distribution shifts. In particular, I will describe how pre-trained models avoid learning spurious correlations, when data augmentation helps and hurts, and how large language models can be leveraged to improve few-shot learning.

  title: Investigate Procedural Events in a Multimodal Fashion
  abstract: |
    Recently, there has been growing attention to studying procedural events while most of them focus on the text. We utilize multimodal as a tool to probe the procedure knowledge. This talk will introduce two projects: 1) Visual Goal-Step Inference using wikiHow -- Understanding what sequence of steps are needed to complete a goal can help artificial intelligence systems reason about human activities. We propose the Visual Goal-Step Inference (VGSI) task, where a model is given a textual goal and must choose which of four images represents a plausible step towards that goal. 2) Induce, Edit, Retrieve: Language Grounded Multimodal Schema for Instructional Video Retrieval -- Schemas are structure representations of complex tasks that can aid artificial intelligence by allowing models to break down complex tasks into intermediate steps. We propose a novel system that induces schemas from web videos and generalizes schemas for unseen tasks to improve video retrieval performance.

  title: Toward Broad and Deep Language Understanding for Intelligent Systems
  abstract: |
    The early vision of AI included the goal of endowing intelligent systems with human-like language processing capabilities. This proved harder than expected, leading the vast majority of natural language processing practitioners to pursue less ambitious, shorter-term goals. Whereas the utility of human-like language processing is unquestionable, its feasibility is quite justifiably questioned. In this talk, I will not only argue that some approximation of human-like language processing is possible, I will present a program of R&D that is working on making it a reality. This vision, as well as progress to date, is described in the book Linguistics for the Age of AI (MIT Press, 2021).

  title: Language Models Memorize their Training Data; Dataset Deduplication Helps
  abstract: |
    Large neural language models are capable of memorizing their training data. First, I will discuss why this memorization is bad and the subtleties involved in studying harmful memorization tendencies. Then, I will go over some early results on the circumstances under which GPT-Neo, a popular public language model, exhibits memorization. Finally, I will describe our recent paper on deduplicating training data and discuss how models trained on deduplicated data memorize less, are more efficient to train, and possibly generalize better. I will also examine the problem of train-test leakage in existing popular datasets.

  title: Overclaiming in NLP Is a Serious Problem. Underclaiming May Be Worse.
  abstract: |
    In an effort to avoid reinforcing widespread hype about the capabilities of state-of-the-art language technology systems, researchers have developed practices in framing and citation that serve to deemphasize the field's successes, even at the cost of making misleadingly strong claims about the limits of our best systems. This is a problem, though, and it may be more serious than it looks: It limits our ability to mitigate short-term harms from NLP deployments and it limits our ability to prepare for the potentially-enormous impacts of more distant future systems. This paper urges researchers to be careful about these claims, and suggests some research directions that will make it easier to avoid or rebut them.

  title: "Socially Aware Language Technologies: Theory, Method, and Practice"
  abstract: |
    Natural language processing (NLP) has had increasing success and produced extensive industrial applications. Despite being sufficient to enable these applications, current NLP systems often ignore the social part of language, e.g., who says it, in what context, for what goals.  In this talk, we take a closer look at social factors in language via a new theory taxonomy and its interplay with computational methods via two lines of work.  The first one studies hate speech and racial bias by introducing a benchmark corpus on implicit hate speech and computational models on detecting and explaining latent hatred in language.  The second part demonstrates how more structures of conversations can be utilized to generate better summaries for everyday interaction.  We conclude by discussing several open-ended questions about how to build socially aware language technologies.

  title: Incidental Supervision for Natural Language Understanding
  abstract: |
    It is labor-intensive to acquire human annotations for natural language understanding (NLU) tasks because annotation can be complex and often requires significant linguistic expertise. Therefore, it is important to investigate how to get supervision from indirect signals and improve one's target task. In this topic, we focus on improving NLU by exploiting incidental supervision signals. Specifically, our goal is to first provide a better understanding of incidental signals, and then design more efficient algorithms to collect, select, and use incidental signals for NLU tasks. This problem is challenging because of the intrinsic differences between incidental supervision signals and target tasks. In addition, the complicated properties of natural language, such as variability and ambiguity, make the problem more challenging. Our contribution to this line of work so far is in three directions. First, we show how to exploit information from cheap signals to help other tasks. Specifically, we retrieve distributed representations from question-answering (QA) pairs to help various downstream tasks. Second, in order to facilitate selecting appropriate incidental signals for a given target task, we propose a unified informativeness measure to quantify the benefits of various incidental signals. Finally, we design efficient algorithms to exploit specific types of incidental signals, where we design a new weighted training algorithm to improve the sample efficiency of learning from cross-task signals. In the future, we plan to further investigate the usage of incidental signals for NLU tasks by better understanding the properties of natural language. Specifically, we propose to work on reasoning in natural language, and study the benefit of the structure in NLU tasks.

  title: Harnessing Scientific Literature for Boosting Discovery and Innovation
  abstract: |
    In the year 1665, the first academic journal was published. Fast forward to today, there are millions of scientific papers coming out every year. This explosion of knowledge represents an opportunity to accelerate innovation with automated systems that scour the literature for solutions and inspirations. However, it also creates information overload and isolated “research bubbles” that limit discovery and sharing, slowing down scientific progress and cross-fertilization. In this talk, I will present our work toward addressing these large-scale challenges for the future of science. In the first part of the talk, I will overview our core approach which consists of identifying key “building blocks” of scientific thought, formalizing and structuring them into computational representations that power creative innovation systems we construct. These include systems that surface inspirations, recommend novel authors, enable search for challenges, hypotheses and causal relations, and tools for exploration and visualization of collaboration networks. The second part of the talk will consist of a dive into our new work -- SciCo: Hierarchical Cross-Document Coreference for Scientific Concepts (AKBC 2021) -- motivated by some of the applications above.  We present a new task of cross-document coreference with a referential hierarchy over mention clusters, including a new challenging dataset and models. Finally, if time permits, I will discuss our recent paper --- Scientific Language Models for Biomedical Knowledge Base Completion: An Empirical Study (AKBC 2021), where we integrate language models and graph embeddings to boost biomedical link prediction with applications in drug discovery.

  title: Learning Representations for Dense Retrieval
  abstract: |
    Dense retrieval has become a new paradigm to retrieve relevant text information in open-domain question answering and other knowledge-intensive NLP tasks. Compared to sparse, non-trainable vector space models, dense retrieval holds great promise in better capturing semantic relationships (e.g., synonyms and paraphrases) between the query and retrieved text units. However, training dense vector models from limited labeled data and scale them to a large text corpus remains challenging. In this talk, I will discuss two recent studies: (1) Dense Passage Retriever (DPR), a simple and effective method that allows learning a dense retriever from a small number of question-answer pairs. It greatly outperforms BM25 and can be used with an extractive or generative reader model for QA and other tasks. (2) DensePhrases, which builds an index of dense representations of all the phrases at the Wikipedia scale. We can directly run retrieval at phrase level and obtain extreme runtime efficiency and competitive performance. DensePhrases can also be used as a dense knowledge base.

  title: Natural Language Processing for Enhanced Mental Healthcare
  abstract: |
    In recent years, there has been an increasing need for psychotherapy to address a wide variety of behavioral and mental health issues. This need has become even more prominent during the ongoing pandemic as COVID-19 related concerns have increased mental distress. Developing computational methods that gain a better understanding of mental health conversations can help practitioners to improve the quality of care. In this talk, I will first describe work on  identifying conversational behaviors that lead to successful counseling interactions. Next, I will present ongoing work on developing a counseling dialog generation system that can assist counselors while acquiring and improving counseling skills. In particular,  I will describe a counseling dialog system that provides language feedback to counseling trainees using the pretrained transformer architecture and context augmentation techniques inspired by traditional strategies used during counseling training.

  title: "Extracting from Adversarial Text with a Visual Character-Based Model: extracting phone numbers from human trafficking ads"
  abstract: |
     Adversarial text is written with obfuscated words and characters for the purpose of fooling machine learned extractors. Illicit domains like human trafficking often employ such techniques. This talk will address the challenge of extracting phone numbers from this noisy text, such as "3w?n7_callme28tree(?nE)_573", but more broadly the talk will discuss the NLP challenge of dealing with unicode characters in any domain. With very little available training data for human trafficking, how can today's neural models learn to generalize to the diversity of noise available to an adversarial writer? This talk will present a couple solutions to this challenge, focusing on character-based neural models that use NLP architectures like LSTMs and CRFs, but also that draw inspiration from the vision community to perform image recognition of the characters with CNNs. I'll first present results from our Best Paper Award at the Workshop for Noisy User-Generated text, exploring extraction from short text snippets, and then show simple steps to expand it to full document extraction.

  title: "Cross-Lingual Transfer in Low-Data Regimes: On Some Achievements, Trends, and Challenges"
  abstract: |
    A key challenge in cross-lingual NLP is developing general language-independent architectures that will be equally applicable to any language. However, this ambition is hindered by the large variation in 1) structural and semantic properties of the world’s languages, as well as 2) raw and task data scarcity for many different languages, tasks, and domains. As a consequence, existing language technology is still largely limited to a handful of resource-rich languages. In this talk, we introduce and discuss a range of recent techniques and breakthroughs that aim to deal with such large cross-language variations and low-data regimes efficiently. We cover a range of cutting-edge approaches including adapter-based models for cross-lingual transfer, contextual parameter generation and hypernetworks, learning in few-shot and zero-shot scenarios, and typologically driven learning and source selection. Finally, this talk demonstrates that low-resource languages, despite very positive research trends and results achieved in recent years, still lag behind major languages, and outline several key challenges for future research in this area.

  title: "Where NLG Meets People: Text Generation Models and Evaluation for Human-Machine Collaboration"
  abstract: |
    Natural language generation (NLG) models' ability to generate long, fluent texts has enabled progress and new applications across many NLG subfields, but it also poses challenges for model evaluation. In this talk, I will discuss how we can use NLG models in a collaborative setting to offer suggestions to people as they perform a creative writing task. I will present a "machine-in-the-loop" framework for machine-writer collaboration and show how it can be used to improve NLG models. I will also discuss the challenge of evaluating long, fluent passages of generated text and introduce Sentence Mover's Similarity, a metric for automatically evaluating multi-sentence text. Finally, I will discuss the role of human evaluations in NLG and propose directions for collecting better human evaluations for current NLG models.

  title: "Neural Generation Meets Real People: Towards Emotionally Engaging Mixed-Initiative Conversations"
  abstract: |
    In this talk I will present Chirpy Cardinal, an open-domain dialogue agent built by the Stanford NLP team in the 2019-2020 Alexa Prize competition. Building an open-domain socialbot that talks to real people is challenging – such a system must meet multiple user expectations such as broad world knowledge, conversational style, and emotional connection. Our socialbot engages users on their terms – prioritizing their interests, feelings and autonomy. As a result, our socialbot provides a responsive, personalized user experience, capable of talking knowledgeably about a wide variety of topics, as well as chatting empathetically about ordinary life. Neural generation plays a key role in achieving these goals, providing the backbone for our conversational and emotional tone. Chirpy Cardinal ultimately won 2nd place in the competition, with a 3.6/5.0 average customer rating. In this talk I will cover the technical details of the bot, analysis of its strengths and weaknesses, unexpected findings during the competition, and future work.

  title: "Best Practices for using Natural Language Models: A Case Study from Gendered Correlations"
  abstract: |
    Natural language processing has seen significant progress over the past several years, with pre-trained models like BERT, ALBERT, ELECTRA, and XLNet achieving remarkable accuracy across a variety of tasks. In pre-training, representations are learned from a large text corpus, using masked language modeling. The resulting representations encode rich information about language and correlations between concepts, such as surgeons and scalpels. Given the broad adoption of these representations in many NLP tasks, it is crucial to understand the information encoded in them and how any learned correlations affect performance downstream. I will present two works in this direction, “Measuring and Reducing Gendered Correlations in Pre-trained Models” and "Scalable Cross Lingual Pivots to Model Pronoun Gender for Translation". In the first, we perform a case study on BERT and its low-memory counterpart ALBERT, looking at correlations related to gender, and formulate a series of best practices for using pre-trained language models: (i) It is important to measure for unintended correlations; (ii) Be careful even when making seemingly innocuous configuration changes; and (iii) There are opportunities for general mitigations. In the second, we explore how to leverage the rich representations in BERT to improve gendered pronoun accuracy in machine translation.

  title: Modeling the Spread of Information within Novels
  abstract: |
    Understanding the ways in which information flows through social networks is important for questions of influence--including tracking the spread of cultural trends and disinformation and measuring shifts in public opinion.  Much work in this space has focused on networks where nodes, edges and information are all directly observed (such as Twitter accounts with explicit friend/follower edges and retweets as instances of propagation); in this talk, I will focus on the comparatively overlooked case of information propagation in *implicit* networks--where we seek to discover single instances of a message passing from person A to person B to person C, only given a depiction of their activity in text.

    Literature in many ways presents an ideal domain for modeling information propagation described in text, since it depicts a largely closed universe in which characters interact and speak to each other.  At the same time, it poses several wholly distinct challenges--in particular, both the length of literary texts and the subtleties involved in extracting information from fictional works pose difficulties for NLP systems optimized for other domains.  In this talk, I will describe our work in measuring information propagation in these implicit networks, and detail an NLP pipeline for discovering it, focusing in detail on new datasets we have created for tagging characters and their coreference in text.  This is joint work with Matt Sims, Olivia Lewke, Anya Mansoor, Sejal Popat and Sheng Shen.

  title: Addressing the Paradox of Flexible but Reliable Text Generation
  abstract: "Text generation is a paradox. We want our generation models to imitate patterns in training data, but also have the flexibility to work in new settings and behave in new ways. We want our models to say creative things, but also be reliable and factual with respect to their inputs. How can we achieve these dual goals with a single system? Our work focuses on generation systems that are controlled and assessed in fine-grained ways: control mechanisms can help enumerate diverse inputs, which are then assessed according to our desired criteria. I will describe work in paraphrasing and summarization where intermediate syntactic control mechanisms can make our models more expressive. I will then describe how to assess these models' outputs from the standpoint of factuality and grammaticality in a fine-grained way, localizing errors to individual words and dependency arcs. By achieving diversity and then enforcing quality, we can build systems that are simultaneously flexible and reliable enough to handle a range of generation settings."

  title: Towards High Precision Text Generation
  abstract: "Despite large advances in neural text generation in terms of fluency, existing generation techniques are prone to hallucination and often produce output that is unfaithful or irrelevant to the source text. In this talk, we take a multi-faceted approach to this problem from 3 aspects: data, evaluation, and modeling. From the data standpoint, we propose ToTTo, a tables-to-text-dataset with high quality annotator revised references that we hope can serve as a benchmark for high precision text generation task.  While the dataset is challenging, existing n-gram based evaluation metrics are often insufficient to detect hallucinations. To this end, we propose BLEURT, a fully learnt end-to-end metric based on transfer learning that can quickly adapt to measure specific evaluation criteria and a model based on confidence decoding to mitigate hallucinations. Finally, I will discuss GEM, a living benchmark for generation that is the result of a large collaboration among many institutions, and will be an ACL 2021 workshop this year"

  title: Dense Retrieval for Question Answering
  abstract: Open-domain question answering relies on efficient passage retrieval to select candidate contexts, where traditional sparse vector space models, such as TF-IDF or BM25, are the de facto method.  In this talk, we discuss recent work which shows that retrieval can be practically implemented using dense representations alone, where embeddings are learned from a small number of questions and passages by a simple dual-encoder framework. When evaluated on a wide range of open-domain QA datasets, our dense retriever outperforms a strong Lucene-BM25 system largely by 9%-19% absolute in terms of top-20 passage retrieval accuracy, and helps our end-to-end QA system establish new state-of-the-art on multiple open-domain QA benchmarks.  We also discuss extensions to the multi-hop setting, where we can outperform competing approaches with 10x less computation.

  title: "Fighting COVID-19 using Parsing Algorithms and Grammar Formalisms"
  abstract: |
    To defeat the current COVID-19 pandemic, a messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccine has emerged as a promising approach thanks to its rapid and scalable production and non-infectious and non-integrating properties. However, designing an mRNA sequence to achieve high stability and protein yield remains a challenging problem due to the exponentially large search space (e.g., there are 2.4 x 10^632 possible mRNA sequence candidates for the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2). We describe two on-going efforts for this problem, both using linear-time algorithms inspired by my earlier work in natural language parsing. On one hand, the Eterna OpenVaccine project from Stanford Medical School takes a crowd-sourcing approach to let game players all over the world design stable sequences. To evaluate sequence stability (in terms of free energy), they use LinearFold from my group (2019) since it’s the only linear-time RNA folding algorithm available (which makes it the only one fast enough for COVID-scale genomes). On the other hand, we take a computational approach to directly search for the optimal sequence in this exponentially large space via dynamic programming. It turns out this problem can be reduced to a classical problem in formal language theory and computational linguistics (intersection between CFG and DFA), which can be solved in O(n^3) time, just like lattice parsing for speech. In the end, we can design the optimal mRNA vaccine candidate for SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in just about 10 minutes.

    This talk is dedicated to the memory of my PhD advisor Aravind Joshi who taught me that linguistics and biology share the same mathematical foundations.

  title: Statistical Significance Testing for Natural Language Processing
  abstract: |
    Data-driven experimental analysis has become the main evaluation tool of Natural Language Processing (NLP) algorithms. In fact, in the last decade, it has become rare to see an NLP paper, particularly one that proposes a new algorithm, that does not include extensive experimental analysis, and the number of involved tasks, datasets, domains, and languages is constantly growing. This emphasis on empirical results highlights the role of statistical significance testing in NLP research: If we, as a community, rely on empirical evaluation to validate our hypotheses and reveal the correct language processing mechanisms, we better be sure that our results are not coincidental.

    In this talk, I will go through the main chapters of the book in the title (https://www.morganclaypool.com/doi/abs/10.2200/S00994ED1V01Y202002HLT045) and answer the following questions: How to choose a valid statistical test for your experiments? How to perform statistical analysis when experimenting with multiple datasets? How to compare deep neural models in a statistically valid manner? And some more surprises...

  title: "Closing the Loop in Natural Language Interfaces to Relational Databases: Parsing, Dialogue, and Generation"
  abstract: |
    Natural Language is a very efficient method of communication among humans. However, when users want to talk to their computers, translating this NL to computer actions is a very challenging task. One possible way for such human-computer interaction is to translate NL sentences to database queries and then to convert the output of these queries back to NL. In order for such an approach to work, one needs to address several challenges: the lack of annotated question-query pairs, the discourse issues present in multi-turn questions, and the issues that arise in a dialogue context.

    In this presentation, I will talk about recent work on natural language interfaces to databases. As part of the Yale Spider project, we have developed three new datasets and launched three matching shared tasks. Spider is a collection of 10,181 manually created natural language questions on databases from 138 domains, and the 5,693 database queries that correspond to them. SParC (Semantic Parsing in Context) consists of 4,298 coherent sequences of questions and the matching queries. Finally, CoSQL consists of WoZ 3k dialogues and a total of 30k turns, and their translations to SQL.

    I will then introduce GraPPa, a pre-training approach for table semantic parsing that learns a compositional inductive bias in the joint representations of textual and tabular data. We used GraPPa to obtain SOTA performance on four popular fully supervised and weakly supervised table semantic parsing benchmarks.

  title: "You can lead a horse to water...: Representing vs. Using Features in Neural NLP"
  abstract: "A wave of recent work has sought to understand how pretrained language models work. Such analyses have resulted in two seemingly contradictory sets of results. On one hand, work based on \"probing classifiers\" generally suggests that SOTA language models contain rich information about linguistic structure (e.g., parts of speech, syntax, semantic roles). On the other hand, work which measures performance on linguistic \"challenge sets\" shows that models consistently fail to use this information when making predictions. In this talk, I will present a series of results that attempt to bridge this gap. Our recent experiments suggest that the disconnect is not due to catastrophic forgetting nor is it (entirely) explained by insufficient training data. Rather, it is best explained in terms of how \"accessible\" features are to the model following pretraining, where \"accessibility\" can be quantified using an information-theoretic interpretation of probing classifiers."

  title: "Where Neural Networks Fail: The Case for a Little Help from Knowledge"
  abstract: "Today's dominant paradigm for modeling complex linguistic tasks calls for training neural networks by minimizing loss on massive datasets.  While the agenda is undeniably successful, we may not have the luxury of annotated data for every task or domain of interest.  Reducing dependence on labeled examples may require us to rethink how we supervise models. In this talk, I will discuss some failures of today's end-to-end trained neural networks. In particular, I will focus on two phenomena---societal stereotypes implicitly present in their decisions, and their inability to perform complex reasoning---both due to the models inability to internalize knowledge about the world. Following this, I will describe our work on using knowledge to inform neural networks without introducing additional parameters. Declarative rules stated in logic can be systematically compiled into computation graphs that augment the structure of neural models, and also into regularizers that can use labeled or unlabeled examples.  I will present experiments involving text understanding and semantic role labeling, which show that such declaratively constrained neural networks can successfully internalize the information in the rules, providing an easy-to-use mechanism for supervising neural networks that does not involve data annotation."

  title: "Simultaneous Translation: Breakthrough and Recent Progress"
  abstract: "Simultaneous interpretation (i.e., translating concurrently with the source language speech) is widely used in many scenarios including multilateral organizations (UN/EU), international summits (APEC/G-20), legal proceedings, and press conferences. However, it is well known to be one of the most challenging tasks for humans due to the simultaneous perception and production in two languages. As a result, there are only a few thousand professional simultaneous interpreters world-wide, and each of them can only sustain for 15-30 minutes in each turn. On the other hand, simultaneous translation (either speech-to-text or speech-to-speech) is also notoriously difficult for machines and has remained one of the holy grails of AI. A key challenge here is the word order difference between the source and target languages. For example, if you simultaneously translate German (an SOV language) to English (an SVO language), you often have to wait for the sentence-final German verb. Therefore, most existing \"real-time\" translation systems resort to conventional full-sentence translation, causing an undesirable latency of at least one sentence, rendering the audience largely out of sync with the speaker. There have been efforts towards genuine simultaneous translation, but with limited success. Recently, we discovered a much simpler and surprisingly effective approach to simultaneous (speech-to-text) translation by designing a \"prefix-to-prefix\" framework tailed to simultaneity requirements. This is in contrast with the \"sequence-to-sequence\" framework which assumes the availability of the full input sentence. Our approach results in the first simultaneous translation system that achieves reasonable translation quality with controllable latency and was successfully deployed in many commercial products. Since 2019, our work has attracted renewed interest in this long-standing problem which was once thought to be out of reach. I will also discuss our efforts towards the ultimate goal of simultaneous speech-to-speech translation, and conclude with a list of remaining challenges. (Part of this talk was given as an ACL 2019 Keynote, but this Clunch talk will cover more recent progress.)"

  title: Building Robust Conversational Question Answering Systems Over Databases of Tabular Data
  abstract: A vast amount of information is stored in relational databases consisting of tables. These databases provide fundamental frameworks of data systems for business in various domains. In real-world applications, users would like to interact with databases for information requests just like talking to a human. However, querying databases requires proficiency in the SQL query language syntax and the knowledge of underlying table structures. Consequently, despite the enormous popularity of relational databases, the ability to retrieve information from these databases is still limited for many ordinary users. In this talk, I will describe some completed and ongoing efforts to build conversational question answering systems over databases of tabular data that is (1) robust to user queries by handling different types of user inputs, (2) conversational and interactive by conversing with users in a dialog setting with its reasoning ability over multi-turn contexts of interaction history, (3) explainable and verifiable by generating natural language explanations of system predicted SQL queries and execution results for user verification and feedback, (4) transferable and adaptable by quickly adapting to different domains and scenarios of databases.

After proposing a new QA-based metric, I benchmark its performance on current datasets, identify performance bottlenecks, and estimate its upper-bound performance, concluding QA is a promising future research direction.

  title: Modelling Language and the World
  abstract: Much recent progress in NLP has been driven by training language models on large unlabelled datasets. I will argue that language modelling requires both linguistic and world knowledge, but that these can be disentangled and modelled separately. First, I will describe kNN-LM, which shows how converting a language model into a nearest neighbor classifier can give large gains in performance, by giving the model access to facts in the training set during inference. I will then introduce MARGE, a new approach to pre-training sequence-to-sequence models with an unsupervised paraphrasing objective. This objective emphasises learning to paraphrase over memorizing facts. MARGE performs well on classification, generation and retrieval tasks in many languages, without supervision in some cases, making it arguably the most broadly applicable pre-trained model to date.

  title: The Polarization and Nationalization of American State Party Platforms, 1918-2017
  abstract: The role of U.S. state political parties has changed substantially in recent decades. One common supposition is that contemporary state parties are increasingly polarized and nationalized, meaning that the Democratic and Republican parties adopt similar positions nationwide. Yet, the relationship between these shifts, the mechanisms underpinning them, and the extent to which they have unfolded similarly across states and issue areas remain open questions. We introduce a data set of 2,041 state party platforms to measure nationalization and polarization between 1918 and 2018. Applying tools from automated and manual content analysis, we find that there is a dramatic divergence in the topics covered in Democratic and Republican platforms starting in the early 1990s, at virtually the same time as federal-level rhetorical polarization. During this same period, the differences across states in platforms decreased and social issues became more prominent, suggesting a tight connection between polarization, nationalization, and social issues such as abortion.

What should we consider as the base unit of a story (e.g., a sentence? a paragraph? a chapter?) What kind of data should we use to train these models (novels? short stories? overly simplistic mechanically-turked paragraphs?) Is any model architecture currently capable of producing long-form narratives that have some semblance of coherent discourse structure, such as plot arcs and character development? When evaluating the outputs of our models, can we do better than just asking people to rate the text based on vaguely defined properties such as \"enjoyability\"? In this talk, I'll discuss my lab's ongoing work on story generation by introducing a new dataset and evaluation method that we hope will spur progress in this area. I'll then describe practical challenges (slow inference, unsecure models) that we face when deploying our models in real-world author-facing settings, along with some solutions we have developed to combat these challenges."

Yet no serious researcher actually believes that these systems understand language, or even really solve the underlying tasks behind these datasets.  To get benchmarks that we actually believe in, we need to both think more deeply about the language phenomena that our benchmarks are targeting, and make our evaluation sets more rigorous.  I will first present ORB, an Open Reading Benchmark that collects many reading comprehension datasets that we (and others) have recently built, targeting various aspects of what it means to read.  I will then present contrast sets, a way of creating non-iid test sets that more thoroughly evaluate a model's abilities on some task, decoupling training data artifacts from test labels."

  title: Cross-Lingual Transfer of Natural Language Processing Systems
  abstract: "Accurate natural language processing systems rely heavily on annotated datasets. In the absence of such datasets, transfer methods can help to develop a model by transferring annotations from one or more rich-resource languages to the target language of interest. These methods are generally divided into two approaches: 1) annotation projection from translation data, aka parallel data, using supervised models in rich-resource languages, and 2) direct model transfer from annotated datasets in rich-resource languages. In this talk, we present different methods for transfer of syntactic and semantic dependency parsers. We propose an annotation projection method that performs well in scenarios for which a large amount of in-domain parallel data is available. We also propose a method which is a combination of annotation projection and direct model transfer that can leverage a minimal amount of information from a small out-of-domain parallel dataset to develop highly accurate transfer models. Furthermore, we present an unsupervised syntactic reordering model to improve the accuracy of dependency parser transfer for non-European languages. We also propose a method for cross-lingual transfer of dependency parsing based on multi-task learning by leveraging supervised syntactic information in the target language of interest. Finally, we introduce our current efforts for learning cross-lingual representations using information from different modalities especially from images in the massively multilingual image dataset (MMID)."

However, it is often challenging for practitioners to choose or adapt solutions from such a bewildering marketplace of algorithms, as it could demand deep ML expertise and bespoke innovations. This talk will present an attempt to systematize several paradigms of algorithms for both a unifying understanding and new systematic methodologies of creating ML solutions. I will show that some of the popular algorithms in supervised learning, constraint-driven learning, reinforcement learning, etc, indeed share a common succinct formulation, showing that different forms of experience can be used for learning in the same way. The unifying representation of algorithms allows us to methodically exchange solutions between paradigms, and learn from combinations of experience jointly, for complex problems such as text and image generation.

  title: Neural Module Networks for Reasoning over Text
  abstract: Answering compositional questions that require multiple steps of reasoning against text is challenging, especially when they involve discrete, symbolic operations. Neural module networks (NMNs) learn to parse such questions as executable programs composed of learnable modules, performing well on synthetic visual QA domains. In this talk, I will outline the challenges in learning these models for non-synthetic questions on open-domain text, where a model needs to deal with the diversity of natural language and perform a broader range of reasoning. Then, I will present how we extend NMNs by (a) introducing modules that reason over a paragraph of text, performing symbolic reasoning (such as arithmetic, sorting, counting) over numbers and dates in a probabilistic and differentiable manner; and (b) proposing an unsupervised auxiliary loss to help extract arguments associated with the events in text. Additionally, we show that a limited amount of heuristically-obtained question program and intermediate module output supervision provides sufficient inductive bias for accurate learning. In conclusion, I will present methods for achieving interpretability in such compositional neural models and challenges for future research.

  title: Injecting output constraints into neural NLP models in a model agnostic way
  abstract: |+
    The talk discusses a particular method of injecting constraints into neural models, primarily for natural language processing (NLP) tasks. While neural models have set the new state of the art performance in many tasks from vision to NLP, they often fail to learn simple rules necessary for well-formed structures unless there is an immense amount of training data. The talk claims that not all the aspects of the model have to be learned from the data itself and injecting simple knowledge/constraints into the neural models can help low-resource tasks as well as improving state-of-the-art models.

    The talk focuses on the structural knowledge of the output space and injects knowledge of correct or preferred structures as an objective to the model in a model-agnostic way, i.e. without modification to the model structure. The first benefit of focusing on the knowledge of output space is that it is intuitive as we can directly enforce outputs to satisfy logical/linguistic constraints. Another advantage of structural knowledge is that it often does not require a labeled dataset.

    Focusing on the example of Semantic Role Labeling and its constraints related to the syntactic parse tree, the talk showcases the efficacy of the proposed inference algorithm and the proposed semi-supervised learning.

  title: Lean Computer-Generated Poetry as Exploration of Language, Culture, and Computation
  abstract: "Computational poetics is a compelling area of NLP. Poetry has helped to constitute cultures for millennia and its composition is considered one of the most human activities. On the generation side, computational poetics involves the production of poetic language, potentially with meter, rhyme and other forms of musicality, metaphors and their cousins, narrative aspects, and intertextual references. Essentially, the main objective of computationally generated poetry is being culturally and individually resonant for at least some readers or listeners in some cultures. There are a wide variety of approaches, some of which seek to model human creativity, as in the computational creativity community. Work in the area is undertaken by academic researchers, poets and artists, and programmers seeking amusement and diversion during events such as NaNoGenMo (National Novel Generation Month), which accommodates the generation of all sorts of large-scale literature, including poetry. In my talk, I will introduce my own practice as a computational poet, which does not involve developing general models of human creativity. My practice is often considered experimental and sometimes conceptual; it is not, in any case, expressive, that is, mainly concerned with my experiences or with conveying my emotions. Rather, I consider myself a situated and embodied explorer of language, culture, and computation. My means of exploration is the development of computational poetry. My practice involves writing programs that are usually small and simple, based on specific unusual lexicons and combinatorial techniques. As part of inquiring about computation, my work connects with platform studies and deals with specifics of particular computers and programming languages. As I share and discuss some of my specific computational poems, I will describe how this type of NLG work touches on questions of language and thought as studied in, for instance, linguistics, cognitive science, and conventional poetics."

  title: "Sentence-level Semantic Inference: From Diverse Phenomena to Applications"
  abstract: Many NLP tasks involve understanding meaning at the sentence-level. In order to analyze such models, we should decompose sentence-level semantic understanding into a diverse array of smaller, more-focused, fine-grained types of reasoning. This will help improve our understanding of the sentence-level reasoning capabilities of our NLP systems. In this talk, we will focus on Natural Language Inference (NLI), the task of determining if one sentence (hypothesis) can likely be inferred from another (context/premise). NLI has traditionally be used to evaluate how well different models understand language and the relationship between texts. We investigate whether 10 recent NLI datasets require models to reason about both texts, or if the datasets contain biases or statistical irregularities that allow a model to correctly label a context-hypothesis pair by only looking at a hypothesis. In the most popular dataset that we consider, a hypothesis-only model outperforms the majority baseline by over 2x. We will also discuss our recently released dataset, the Diverse NLI Collection (DNC), that can be used to shed light on a model’s ability to capture or understand a diverse array of semantic phenomena that are important to Natural Language Understanding. We will demonstrate how a variant of the DNC has been used to evaluate whether a Neural Machine Translation encoder captures semantic phenomena related to translation. With the remaining time, we will discuss how lessons from these studies can be applied real-world uses cases of sentence-level semantic inference. This talk is based on work that has appeared at NAACL, ACL, StarSem, and EMNLP.

  title: Robot Control and Collaboration in Situated Instruction Following
  abstract: I will present two projects studying the problem of learning to follow natural language instructions. I will present new datasets, a class of interpretable models for instruction following, learning methods that combine the benefits of supervised and reinforcement learning, and new evaluation protocols. In the first part, I will discuss the task of executing natural language instructions with a robotic agent. In contrast to existing work, we do not engineer formal representations of language meaning or the robot environment. Instead, we learn to directly map raw observations and language to low-level continuous control of a quadcopter drone. In the second part, I will propose the task of learning to follow sequences of instructions in a collaborative scenario, where both the user and the system execute actions in the environment and the user controls the system using natural language. To study this problem, we build CerealBar, a multi-player 3D game where a leader instructs a follower, and both act in the environment together to accomplish complex goals. The two projects were led by Valts Blukis, Alane Suhr, and collaborators.

  title: Distributed Semantic Representations from Question-Answering Signals
  abstract: Human annotations, especially those from experts, are costly for many natural language processing (NLP) tasks. One emerging approach is to use natural language to annotate natural language, but it is challenging to get supervision effectively from annotations that are very different from the target task. This paper studies the case where the annotations are in the format of question answering (QA). We propose a novel approach to retrieve two types of semantic representations from QA, using which we can consistently improve on a suite of tasks. This work may have pointed out an alternative way to supervise NLP tasks.

  title: Revisiting post-processing for word embeddings
  abstract: Word embeddings learnt from large corpora have been adopted in various applications in natural language processing and served as the general input representations to learning systems. Recently, a series of post-processing methods have been proposed to boost the performance of word embeddings on similarity comparison and analogy retrieval tasks, and some have been adapted to compose sentence representations. The general hypothesis behind these methods is that by enforcing the embedding space to be more isotropic, the similarity between words can be better expressed. We view these methods as an approach to shrink the covariance/gram matrix, which is estimated by learning word vectors, towards a scaled identity matrix. By optimising an objective in the semi-Riemannian manifold with Centralised Kernel Alignment (CKA), we are able to search for the optimal shrinkage parameter, and provide a post-processing method to smooth the spectrum of learnt word vectors which yields improved performance on downstream tasks.

  title: A General-Purpose Algorithm for Constrained Sequential Inference
  abstract: Inference in structured prediction involves finding the best output structure for an input, subject to certain constraints. Many current approaches use sequential inference, which constructs the output in a left-to-right manner. However, there is no general framework to specify constraints in these approaches. We present a principled approach for incorporating constraints into sequential inference algorithms. Our approach expresses constraints using an automaton, which is traversed in lock-step during inference, guiding the search to valid outputs. We show that automata can express commonly used constraints and are easily incorporated into sequential inference. When it is more natural to represent constraints as a set of automata, our algorithm uses an active set method for demonstrably fast and efficient inference. We experimentally show the benefits of our algorithm on constituency parsing and semantic role labeling. For parsing, unlike unconstrained approaches, our algorithm always generates valid output, incurring only a small drop in performance. For semantic role labeling, imposing constraints using our algorithm corrects common errors, improving F1 by 1.5 points. These benefits increase in low-resource settings. Our active set method achieves a 5.2x relative speed-up over a naive approach.

  title: "Summary Cloze: A New Task for Content Selection in Topic-Focused Summarization"
  abstract: A key challenge in topic-focused summarization is determining what information should be included in the summary, a problem known as content selection. In this work, we propose a new method for studying content selection in topic-focused summarization called the summary cloze task. The goal of the summary cloze task is to generate the next sentence of a summary conditioned on the beginning of the summary, a topic, and a reference document(s). The main challenge is deciding what information in the references is relevant to the topic and partial summary and should be included in the summary. Although the cloze task does not address all aspects of the traditional summarization problem, the more narrow scope of the task allows us to collect a large-scale datset of nearly 500k summary cloze instances from Wikipedia. We report experimental results on this new dataset using various extractive models and a two-step abstractive model that first extractively selects a small number of sentences and then abstractively summarizes them. Our results show that the topic and partial summary help the models identify relevant content, but the task remains a significant challenge.

  title: "\"Going on a vacation\" takes longer than \"Going for a walk\": A Study of Temporal Commonsense Understanding"
  abstract: Understanding time is crucial for understanding events expressed in natural language. Because people rarely say the obvious, it is often necessary to have commonsense knowledge about various temporal aspects of events, such as duration, frequency, and temporal order. However, this important problem has so far received limited attention. This paper systematically studies this temporal commonsense problem. Specifically, we define five classes of temporal commonsense, and use crowdsourcing to develop a new dataset, MCTACO, that serves as a test set for this task. We find that the best current methods used on MCTACO are still far behind human performance, by about 20%, and discuss several directions for improvement. We hope that the new dataset and our study here can foster more future research on this topic.

  title: Neural Networks for Morphological Generation in the Minimal-Resource Setting
  abstract: As languages other than English are moving more and more into the focus of natural language processing, accurate handling of morphology is increasing in importance. This talk presents neural network-based approaches to morphological generation, casting the problem as a character-based sequence-to-sequence task. First, we will generally discuss how to successfully train neural sequence-to-sequence models for this. Then, since many morphologically rich languages only have limited resources, the main part of the talk will focus on how to overcome the challenges that limited amounts of annotated training data pose to neural models. The approaches covered in this talk include multi-task learning, cross-lingual transfer learning, and meta-learning.

  title: Human information processing in complex networks
  abstract: Humans communicate using systems of interconnected stimuli or concepts -- from language and music to literature and science -- yet it remains unclear how, if at all, the structure of these networks supports the communication of information. Although information theory provides tools to quantify the information produced by a system, traditional metrics do not account for the inefficient and biased ways that humans process this information. Here we develop an analytical framework to study the information generated by a system as perceived by a human observer. We demonstrate experimentally that this perceived information depends critically on a system's network topology. Applying our framework to several real networks, we find that they communicate a large amount of information (having high entropy) and do so efficiently (maintaining low divergence from human expectations). Moreover, we show that such efficient communication arises in networks that are simultaneously heterogeneous, with high-degree hubs, and clustered, with tightly-connected modules -- the two defining features of hierarchical organization. Together, these results suggest that many real networks are constrained by the pressures of information transmission, and that these pressures select for specific structural features.

  title: Joint Models for Social, Behavioral and Textual Information
  abstract: Understanding natural language communication often requires context, such as the speakers' backgrounds and social conventions, however, when it comes to computationally modeling these interactions, we typically ignore their broader context and analyze the text in isolation. In this talk, I will review on-going work demonstrating the importance of holistically modeling behavioral, social and textual information. I will focus on several NLP problems, including political discourse analysis on Twitter, partisan news detection and open-domain debate stance prediction, and discuss how jointly modeling text and social behavior can help reduce the supervision effort and provide a better representation for language understanding tasks.

  title: Similarity Inference for Legal Texts
  abstract: Quantifying similarity between pairs of documents is a ubiquitous task. Both researchers and members of the public frequently use document-level pairwise similarity measures to describe or explore unfamiliar corpora, or to test hypotheses regarding diffusion of ideas between authors. High-level similarity measures are particularly useful when dealing with legal or political corpora, which often contain long, thematically diverse, and specialized language that is difficult for non-experts to interpret. Unfortunately, though similarity estimation is a well-studied problem in the context of short documents and document excerpts, less attention has been paid to the problem of similarity inference for long documents.

  title: Comparison of Diverse Decoding Methods from Conditional Language Models
  abstract: While conditional language models have greatly improved in their ability to output high-quality natural language, many NLP applications benefit from being able to generate a diverse set of candidate sequences. Diverse decoding strategies aim to, within a given-sized candidate list, cover as much of the space of high-quality outputs as possible, leading to improvements for tasks that re-rank and combine candidate outputs. Standard decoding methods, such as beam search, optimize for generating high likelihood sequences rather than diverse ones, though recent work has focused on increasing diversity in these methods. We conduct an extensive survey of decoding-time strategies for generating diverse outputs from conditional language models. We also show how diversity can be improved without sacrificing quality by over-sampling additional candidates, then filtering to the desired number.

  title: Detecting whether Text is Human- or Machine-Generated
  abstract: With the advent of generative models with a billion parameters or more, it is now possible to automatically generate vast amounts of human-sounding text. But just how human-like is this machine-generated text? Intuitively, shorter amounts of machine-generated text are harder to detect, but exactly how many words can a machine generate and still fool both humans and trained discriminators? We investigate how the choices of sampling strategy and text sequence length impact discriminability from human-written text, using both automatic detection methods and human judgement.
