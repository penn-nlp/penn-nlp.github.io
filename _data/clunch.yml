  title: Large Language Models & Symbolic Structures
  abstract: Over the past decade the field of NLP has shifted from a pipelined approach (wherein intermediate symbolic structures such as parse trees are explicitly predicted and utilized for downstream tasks) to an end-to-end approach wherein pretrained large language models (LLMs) are adapted to various downstream tasks via finetuning or prompting. What role (if any) can symbolic structures play in the era of LLMs? In the first part of the talk, we will see how latent symbolic structures can be used to guide LLM-based neural machine translation systems to improve translation of low resource language, and also enable the use of new translation rules during inference. In the second part, we will see how expert-derived grammars can be used to control LLMs via prompting for tasks such as semantic parsing where the output structure must obey strict domain-specific constraints.

  title: Uniform Meaning Representations
  abstract: This talk will discuss symbolic representations of sentences in context, focusing on abstract meaning representations (AMR), examining their capability for capturing certain aspects of meaning. A focus will be how AMR’s can be expanded to encompass figurative language, the recovery of implicit arguments and relations between events. These examples will be in English, and indeed some features of AMR are English-centric. Uniform Meaning Representations, a multi-sentence annotation scheme that is revising AMRs to make them more suitable for other languages, especially low resource languages will be introduced. UMRs include more formal logical scope, number, tense, aspect and modality as well as temporal relations. The talk will conclude with a discussion of ways in which these meaning representations can be enriched even more, by mapping to Wikidata Qnodes, and their potential for improving the explainability of large language models

  title: Deconstructing Complex Events through Modeling Uncertainty, States, and Outcomes
  abstract: Situations that people experience or describe---from global, macro-level events like "financial instability" to everyday, micro-level ones like "going to dinner"---can be complex, with uncertainty in what might happen next, participant's actions affecting one another, and overlapping events contributing to an outcome. Developing a computational understanding of these situations is not straightforward. In this talk, I will present methods for learning how to encode richer information about those descriptions. These approaches are a fruitful way of improving modeling performance, the ability to predict what events might happen next, or identify how the different participants in that situation are affected. In the first way, I will examine how event descriptions can be augmented with structural and semantic hierarchy, while accounting for uncertainty in both. In the second, I will look at how we can get models to reason about implicit states of participants in events, and reason about changes to these states as they relate to the broader situation. Finally, I will consider how we can characterize complex events by looking at participant-specific, state-based outcomes.

  title: Concept Bottleneck Models for Text Classification
  abstract: In this work, we apply the concept bottleneck framework to text classification. Traditional explainability methods for text classification often focus on local interpretability, highlighting which tokens are relevant but failing to explain their role in the decision-making process. Our system addresses this by offering concept-level explanations. For example, it can break down a restaurant review rating into individual measurements of concepts such as "ambiance" and "food quality," which linearly combine to yield the final prediction. We utilize large language models to generate and measure these concepts in a zero-shot manner, requiring no external guidance or information beyond the original task dataset. Our system is evaluated on twelve diverse text datasets, ranging from hate speech classification to movie review sentiment, and shows generally positive results. This includes an 89.3% accuracy in measuring machine defined concepts when evaluating using human annotations as a gold standard. Overall, this work presents a promising direction for creating interpretable text classification systems.

  title: "Rewriting the Script: Adapting Text Instructions for Voice Interaction"
  abstract: "Voice assistants have sharply risen in popularity in recent years, but their use has been limited mostly to simple applications like music, hands-free search, or control of internet-of-things devices. What would it take for voice assistants to guide people through more complex tasks? In our work, we study the limitations of the dominant approach voice assistants take to complex task guidance: reading aloud written instructions. Using recipes as an example, we observe twelve participants cook at home with a state-of-the-art voice assistant. We learn that the current approach leads to nine challenges, including obscuring the bigger picture, overwhelming users with too much information, and failing to communicate affordances. Instructions delivered by a voice assistant are especially difficult because they cannot be skimmed as easily as written instructions. Alexa in particular did not surface crucial details to the user or answer questions well. We draw on our observations to propose eight ways in which voice assistants can “rewrite the script”—summarizing, signposting, splitting, elaborating, volunteering, reordering, redistributing, and visualizing—to transform written sources into forms that are readily communicated through spoken conversation. We conclude with a vision of how modern advancements in natural language processing can be leveraged for intelligent agents to guide users effectively through complex tasks."
