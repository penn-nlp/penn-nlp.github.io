  title: "Kani: A Lightweight and Highly Hackable Framework for Building Language Model Applications"
  abstract: "Language model applications are becoming increasingly popular and complex, often including features like tool usage and retrieval augmentation. However, existing frameworks for such applications are often opinionated, deciding for developers how their prompts ought to be formatted and imposing limitations on customizability and reproducibility. To solve this we present Kani: a lightweight, flexible, and model-agnostic open-source framework for building language model applications. Kani helps developers implement a variety of complex features by supporting the core building blocks of chat interaction: model interfacing, chat management, and robust function calling. All Kani core functions are easily overridable and well documented to empower developers to customize functionality for their own needs. Kani thus serves as a useful tool for researchers, hobbyists, and industry professionals alike to accelerate their development while retaining interoperability and fine-grained control."

  title: "This Land is {Your, My} Land: Evaluating Geopolitical Biases in Language Models"
  abstract: "Do the Spratly Islands belong to China, the Philippines, or Vietnam? A pretrained large language model (LLM) may answer differently if asked in the languages of each claimant country: Chinese, Tagalog, or Vietnamese. In this paper, we show that LLMs recall certain geographical knowledge inconsistently when queried in different languages—a phenomenon we term geopolitical bias. As a targeted case study, we consider territorial disputes, an inherently controversial and multilingual task. We introduce BorderLines, a dataset of territorial disputes which covers 251 territories, each associated with a set of multiple-choice questions in the languages of each claimant country (49 languages in total). We also propose a suite of evaluation metrics to precisely quantify bias and consistency in responses across different languages. We then evaluate various multilingual LLMs on our dataset and metrics to probe their internal knowledge and use the proposed metrics to discover numerous inconsistencies in how these models respond in different languages. Finally, we explore several prompt modification strategies, aiming to either amplify or mitigate geopolitical bias, which highlights how brittle LLMs are and how they tailor their responses depending on cues from the interaction context."

  title: Developing Grounded Intuition of Large Language Models
  abstract: Large language models in the current era of natural language processing have shown unprecedented performance on increasingly complex tasks, leading to challenges in evaluating models and understanding their limits. Recent studies have turned to example-driven qualitative analysis to gain a better "intuition" of how LLMs respond to intricate, inventive requests. In this work, I propose a new methodology to systematize and substantiate this style of qualitative evaluation in techniques from the social sciences. Using GPT-Vision and scientific images as a case study, I will walk through the qualitative evaluation method, theoretical social science background, and resulting insights---intuition of the model's capabilities grounded in empirical evidence---to show how this method can be used for any generative model. I welcome feedback on adapting the preprint for a conference submission.

  title: Evaluation in the age of Large Language Models
  abstract: "New language models are being developed at a rapid pace. While these models have incredible new abilities, we still mostly follow the same old paradigms when it comes to evaluating the language that these models produce. As a result, claims about their performance rely either on anecdotal evidence or on experiments on anglo-centric corpora with flawed metrics. We thus can’t systematically answer the question that lies at the core of natural language generation research: how good is a system that produces natural language and where does it fail? I will discuss the deliberations of languages, datasets, metrics, and human evaluations that are required to address this problem. I will also connect these insights to broader trends in the industry and how they affect development of new products."

  title: "Principles of Reasoning: Compositional and Collaborative Generative AI"
  abstract: A majority of existing research in large language models and generative AI systems focus on scaling and engineering. In this talk, I argue that we need principled understanding of the science of generative AI, in particular, to understand the emergent ability of large language models. I present a Bayesian latent variable approach to enhancing in-context learning in large language models (LLMs) through optimal demonstration selection, demonstrating substantial improvements across various text classification tasks. Second, I argue that modern generative AI systems must be modular and collaborative, to solve complex reasoning problems. We introduce Logic-LM, an in-context framework that synergizes LLMs with symbolic solvers, significantly boosting logical problem-solving abilities. We will also elaborate how to build in-context neuro-symbolic solutions to improve the compositionality in text-to-image systems. Our observations indicate that the future of generative AI is compositional and collaborative, as opposed to a single-model system.

  title: Propositional Text Representation Learning in the era of LLMs
  abstract: In an era where most NLP problems are solved in a text-in-text-out, end-to-end fashion, do meaning representations of text still matter? The answer is yes, and the benefit it brings might surprise you! I will introduce our recent line of work, where we rethink and redefine the use of propositions in modern NLP.  I will discuss the benefit of propositional text representation learning in LLM-related applications such as hallucination detection, attribution for generated text, and retrieval-augmented generation.

  title: Towards Generalizable and Controllable Reasoning in NLP and AI Systems
  abstract: Advancements in natural language processing (NLP) have spurred a wave of innovation. Still, the reliability and generalizability of language models (LMs) remain areas of concern, blocking them from complex reasoning scenarios or sensitive topics. This talk presents works on augmenting models with experiential knowledge and symbolic reasoning to refine controllable reasoning, improve abduction skills, and bolster model generalizability. We will also examine the limitations of current semantic-based reasoning methods and highlight the integration of symbolic techniques to construct more transparent and explainable decision-making processes. Through synthesizing empirical evidence and theoretical insights, we propose pragmatic pathways toward responsible and trustworthy NLP applications in mission-critical environments.

  title: Extracting Cross-Cultural Social Norms using Moral Emotions
  abstract: In this talk, I will present a culture-agnostic approach to norm discovery, using moral emotions, shame and  pride, to identify examples of normative expectations and extract corresponding social norms. These norms can be used for designing culturally aware NLP systems and achieving pluralistic values in LLMs.

  title: Evaluating Multicultural Behavior of LLMs
  abstract: Multilingual LLMs like GPT-4 and Gemini are linguistically fluent (i.e. they generate fluent non-English text), but not necessarily culturally fluent (i.e. they appropriately reflect the social norms, emotions, and behaviors of users from different cultures). While it is important for us to make these LLMs better at cultural adaptation, we lack proper methods to evaluate the multicultural behavior of these models. Focusing on emotion, I present techniques grounded in cultural psychology to evaluate how well LLMs understand emotional subjectivity across cultures. Despite the fact that emotions are experienced and expressed differently across the world, we find that embeddings obtained from LMs (e.g., XLM-RoBERTa) are Anglocentric, and generative LMs (e.g., ChatGPT) reflect Western norms, even when responding to prompts in other languages. Our results show that multilingual LMs struggle with cultural adaptation and developing proper techniques to evaluate this is an important problem for the NLP community.

  title: Impact of Response Length on LLM-Generated Dialogue Quality and User Perception
  abstract: Large Language Models are often used as conversational agents, even though they are not predominantly trained on dialogue datasets. Consequently, their responses often diverge from those in natural human conversation, tending towards verbosity or, less frequently, brevity. In this paper, we study the impact of optimizing response length on the quality of a dialogue system. Our findings reveal that GPT produces responses that are longer than those of humans, and these are unexpectedly favored, even over human-generated responses, due to their richer informational content and perceived greater empathy. However, for applications such as voicebots, shorter responses could be preferred. To generate responses that match those from humans in length, we introduce RULER, a supervised model that leverages historical conversational data to guide the generation of appropriately lengthed responses. We find that RULER responses are judged to be of higher quality than those from humans, in spite of being comparable in length.

  title: Knowledge-Rich Language Systems in a Dynamic World
  abstract: "Natural language provides an intuitive and powerful interface to access knowledge at scale. Modern language systems draw information from two rich knowledge sources: (1) information stored in their parameters during massive pretraining and (2) documents retrieved at inference time. Yet, we are far from building systems that can reliably provide information from such knowledge sources. In this talk, I will discuss paths for more robust systems. In the first part of the talk, I will present a module for scaling retrieval-based knowledge augmentation. We learn a compressor that maps retrieved documents into textual summaries prior to in-context integration. This not only reduces the computational costs but also filters irrelevant or incorrect information. In the second half of the talk, I will discuss the challenges of updating knowledge stored in model parameters and propose a method to prevent models from reciting outdated information by identifying facts that are prone to rapid change. I will conclude my talk by proposing an interactive system that can elicit information from users when needed. "

  title: "Measuring Wellbeing in Situated Contexts with Social Media and Multimodal Sensing: Promises and Perils"
  abstract: "A core aspect of our social lives is often embedded in the communities we are situated in. Our shared experiences and social ties intertwine our situated context with our wellbeing. A better understanding of wellbeing can help devise timely support provisions. However, traditional forms of wellbeing measurements have limitations, motivating an increasing interest in supporting wellbeing through passive sensing technologies. Parallelly, social media platforms enable us to connect and express our personal and social lives with others. Given its ubiquity, social media can be considered a “passive sensor” to obtain naturalistic data, which can also be combined with various multimodal sensing to comprehensively measure wellbeing. However, wellbeing sensing technologies can lead to unintended outcomes and cause harms. Therefore, despite the potential, are we ready to deploy these wellbeing sensing technologies in the real world yet? In this talk, Koustuv Saha will present theory-driven computational and causal methods for leveraging social media in concert with complementary multisensor data to examine wellbeing, particularly in situated communities such as college campuses and workplaces. He will also interrogate the meaningfulness of the data and inferences and reflect on how these approaches can potentially be misinterpreted or misused without additional considerations. To bridge the gap between the theoretical promise and practical utility, he will present the importance of evaluating the needs, benefits, and harms of wellbeing sensing technologies in practice. This talk will propel the vision toward questioning the underlying assumptions and in responsible design and deployment of wellbeing sensing technologies (if at all) for situated communities and the future of work.

  title: "Theory of Mind and LLMs: What it is and Why it is important"
  abstract: '"Last year, debates about whether large language models (LLMs) demonstrate theory of mind capabilities have sparked considerable interest in the AI field. Theory of mind refers to the ability to attribute mental states to others, a key aspect of human social reasoning. This includes understanding others beliefs, desires, intentions, and thoughts, all of which play a significant role in social interactions. In this talk, I will delve deeper into the following questions: ""Do LLMs have a theory of mind?"", ""What are essential criteria for evaluating theory of mind in LLMs?"", and “Why is theory of mind important in AI systems?” More concretely, this talk will discuss important theoretical foundations from psychology and examine why theory of mind can be critical in addressing privacy concerns in LLMs."'

  title: Conversational AI beyond chatGPT
  abstract: chatGPT amazed the general public with its ability to follow novel instructions. However, there is still a gap between chatGPT and fundamental human conversation abilities. This talk describes two works toward filling this gap through better conversational planning and strategies. The first work, LLM-Augmenter, proposes a general framework that aligns LLM capabilities with user task intents through reinforcement learning planning.  The second work demonstrates that a chatbot with advanced self-disclosure conversational strategies is likelier and more convincing.

  title: Human-AI Interaction in the Age of Large Language Models
  abstract: "Large language models have revolutionized the way humans interact with AI systems, transforming a wide range of fields and disciplines. In this talk, we discuss several approaches to enhancing human-AI interaction using LLMs. The first one looks at training people with conflict resolution skills via LLMs-based simulation and feedback. The second part develops parameter efficient learning techniques for adapting LLMs to low-resource languages and dialects towards accessible human-AI interaction.These different works demonstrate how human-AI interaction via LLMs can empower individuals and foster positive change."

  title: Challenges in Fostering (Dis)Trust in AI       
  abstract: "What factors enable people to trust trustworthy models and distrust untrustworthy models? Broadly, (dis)trust can be derived from two sources: (1) intrinsic, which stems from understanding a model's inner workings or reasoning, and (2) extrinsic, which is based on observing a model's external behaviors. Evaluation benchmarks created by AI researchers can foster extrinsic (dis)trust in a given contract, but they must be properly constructed. Only then can they ensure that a model, to pass the test, must truly uphold the intended contract. I will overview the challenges of constructing valid evaluations. On the other hand, explainable AI (XAI) aims to provide insights into a model’s reasoning, thus fostering intrinsic (dis)trust. XAI is not without its challenges, which I will discuss towards the end of my talk."

  title: Could we be overestimating the linguistic capabilities of LLMs?
  abstract: The evaluation of the linguistic capabilities of LLMs requires not only a target phenomenon, but also labelled natural data at scale or the means to create it artificially, which should be uncontaminated, ideally include languages other than English, and rely on implicit, rather than explicit, knowledge of language. These conditions are especially challenging to satisfy for the rare and complex phenomena that remain as challenges for state-of-the-art models. In this talk, I will present several evaluations of the morphological, syntactic, and semantic capabilities of LLMs,  demonstrate strategies for gathering or creating data and setups to push the boundaries of current evaluation strategies, and show how these can be used to identify remaining LLM linguistic weaknesses.
