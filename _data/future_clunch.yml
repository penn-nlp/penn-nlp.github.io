  title: "AI for Science and Science of AI"
  abstract: |
    AI has seen remarkable advancements, driven largely by the increasing capabilities of LLMs and have sparked excitement around their transformative potential across applications—particularly their role in accelerating scientific discovery.
    <br><br>
    In the first part of this talk, I will focus on our work in AI for science, emphasizing the importance of addressing "aggregative questions" in scientific inquiry. While traditional scientific questions often are “information seeking” queries, (looking for specific information from individual papers), many critical scientific challenges require synthesizing abstractions of evidence across diverse sources. I will highlight our approaches to enabling LLMs to effectively tackle such aggregative tasks.
    <br><br>
    In the second part, I will turn to the science of AI, exploring foundational challenges in training and deploying LLMs. This includes issues related to data quality (such as temporal degradation of knowledge after the model’s training cutoff) and the difficulties posed by imbalanced datasets during pretraining. Our work aims to better understand and address these limitations to improve the reliability of LLMs in scientific contexts.
