  title: "AppWorld: Reliable Evaluation of Interactive Agents in a World of Apps and People"
  abstract: "We envision a world where AI agents (assistants) are widely used for complex tasks in our digital and physical worlds and are broadly integrated into our society. To move towards such a future, we need an environment for a robust evaluation of agents' capability, reliability, and trustworthiness. In this talk, I’ll introduce AppWorld, which is a step towards this goal in the context of day-to-day digital tasks. AppWorld is a high-fidelity simulated world of people and their digital activities on nine apps like Amazon, Gmail, and Venmo. On top of this fully controllable world, we build a benchmark of complex day-to-day tasks such as splitting Venmo bills with roommates, which agents have to solve via interactive coding and API calls. One of the fundamental challenges with complex tasks lies in accounting for different ways in which the tasks can be completed. I will describe how we address this challenge using a reliable and programmatic evaluation framework. Our benchmarking evaluations show that even the best LLMs, like GPT-4o, can only solve ~30% of such tasks, highlighting the challenging nature of the AppWorld benchmark. I will conclude by laying out exciting future research that can be conducted on the foundation of AppWorld, such as benchmarks and playground for developing multimodal, collaborative, safe, socially intelligent, resourceful, and fail-tolerant agents."

  title: "Takeaways from the SCALE 2024 Workshop on Video-based Event Retrieval"
  abstract: "Information dissemination for current events has traditionally consisted of professionally collected and produced materials, leading to large collections of well-written news articles and high-quality videos. As a result, most prior work in event analysis and retrieval has focused on leveraging this traditional news content, particularly in English. However, much of the event-centric content today is generated by non-professionals, such as on-the-scene witnesses to events who hastily capture videos and upload them to the internet without further editing; these are challenging to find due to quality variance, as well as a lack of text or speech overlays providing clear descriptions of what is occurring. To address this gap, SCALE 2024, a 10-week research workshop hosted at the Human Language Technology Center of Excellence (HLTCOE), focused on multilingual event-centric video retrieval, or the task of finding relevant videos about specific current events. Around 50 researchers and students participated in this workshop and were split up into five sub-teams. The Infrastructure team focused on developing MultiVENT 2.0, a challenging video retrieval dataset consisting of 20x more videos than prior work and targeted queries about specific world events across six languages. Other teams worked on improving models from specific modalities, specifically Vision, Optical Character Recognition (OCR), Audio, and Text. Overall, we came away with three primary findings: extracting specific text from a video allows us to take better advantage of powerful methods from the text information retrieval community; LLM summarization of initial text outputs from videos is helpful, especially for noisy text coming from OCR; and no one modality is sufficient, with fusing outputs from all modalities resulting in significantly higher performance."

  title: "DataDreamer: Synthetic Data Generation and Reproducible LLM Workflows"
  abstract: "Large language models (LLMs) have become an essential tool for NLP researchers in a wide range of tasks. Many now rely on LLMs for synthetic data generation, task evaluation, fine-tuning, and other model-in-the-loop workflows. However, challenges arise due to their scale, closed-source nature, and the lack of standardized tooling, which can hinder open science and reproducibility. In this talk, we present DataDreamer, an open-source Python library designed to help researchers implement LLM workflows more easily. DataDreamer also promotes best practices that support open science and improve reproducibility in research."

  title: "Advancing Multimodal AI: Integrating Modalities, Tackling Complex Challenges, and Enhancing Interpretability"
  abstract: "Advancing AI systems that understand and integrate multiple modalities—such as images, language, audio, video, and 3D—has significant implications for real-world applications. A major challenge lies in developing AI models that can efficiently process diverse modalities while providing transparent and interpretable decision-making. This talk will highlight recent contributions, including X-InstructBLIP, a framework for aligning multimodal representations with language models for cross-modal reasoning; studies on bistable images that reveal how AI models interpret visual ambiguity; and ongoing work on visual unit testing to ensure robust, and interpretable multimodal reasoning."

  title: "Better Evaluations for Multimodal Generative Models"
  abstract: "Multimodal generative models such as GPT-4o and DALL-E 3 are being developed at a rapid pace. While these models have incredible new abilities, we still mostly follow the same old paradigms when it comes to evaluating the language or images that these models produce. Consequently, these models' potential is constrained by outdated evaluation criteria. In this talk, we will introduce two new benchmarks: (1) BLINK, designed to assess core visual perception abilities that are not addressed by existing benchmarks for multimodal large language models; and (2) Commonsense-T2I, which tests whether the generated images align with real-life commonsense. Our findings show that current multimodal generative models perform significantly worse than humans on both benchmarks, highlighting potential pathways for future improvements."

  title: "Can LLMs Reason and Plan?"
  abstract: "Large Language Models (LLMs) are on track to reverse what seemed like an inexorable shift of AI from explicit to tacit knowledge tasks. Trained as they are on everything ever written on the web, LLMs exhibit “approximate omniscience”–they can provide answers to all sorts of queries, but with nary a guarantee. This could herald a new era for knowledge-based AI systems–with LLMs taking the role of (blowhard?) experts. But first, we have to stop confusing the impressive style/form of the generated knowledge for correct/factual content, and resist the temptation to ascribe reasoning, planning, self-critiquing etc. powers to approximate retrieval by these n-gram models on steroids. We have to focus instead on LLM-Modulo techniques that complement the unfettered idea generation of LLMs with careful vetting by model-based verifiers (the models underlying which themselves can be teased out from LLMs in semi-automated fashion). In this talk, I will reify this vision and attendant caveats in the context of our ongoing work on understanding the role of LLMs in planning tasks."
