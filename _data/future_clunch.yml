  title: "Self-Supervised Language-and-Vision Reasoning"
  abstract: |
     A key challenge for Artificial Intelligence research is to go beyond static observational data and consider more challenging settings that involve dynamic actions and incremental decision-making. In this talk, I will introduce our work on visually-grounded language reasoning via the studies of vision-and-language navigation. In particular, I will emphasize three benefits of self-supervised learning: (1) improves generalization in unseen environments; (2) creates adversarial counterfactuals to augment observational data; (3) enables transfer learning for challenging settings. I will briefly introduce other reasoning problems my groups have been working on recently.

  title: "Text Generation: The Curious Case of Figurative Language and Argumentation"
  abstract: |
     Large-scale language models based on transformer architectures, such as GPT-3 or BERT, have advanced the state of the art in Natural Language Understanding and Generation. However, even though these models have shown impressive performance for a variety of tasks, they often struggle to model implicit and/or non-compositional meaning, such as figurative language and argumentative text. In this talk, I will present some of our work on text generation models for figurative language and argumentation. There are two main challenges we have to address to make progress in this space: 1) the need to model common sense and/or connotative knowledge required for these tasks; and 2) the lack of large training datasets. I will discuss our proposed theoretically-grounded knowledge-enhanced text generation models for figurative language such as metaphor and for argument reframing. If time permits I will share our recent efforts of using a model-in-the-loop approach for building datasets for figurative language understanding modeled as an entailment task with explanation generation.
