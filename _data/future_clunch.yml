  title: Towards Continually Adaptable Multilingual Language Models
  abstract: Subword tokenization in multilingual models presents significant challenges, particularly for non-Latin scripts and low-resource languages. Existing methods not only perform worse in these settings but also lead to higher costs in LLM APIs due to inefficiencies in token representation. Furthermore, incorporating emerging languages into pre-trained models remains difficult, with prior work often relying on heuristics like vocabulary expansion. To address these issues, I will first present MAGNET, a multilingual adaptive gradient-based tokenization algorithm that is jointly trained with a language model. Unlike standard tokenization approaches, MAGNET operates at the byte level and learns to predict segment boundaries dynamically via a tokenizer sub-module. A simple hyperparameter allows controlling over segmentation granularity, ensuring equitable treatment across languages. Its end-to-end training enables seamless adaptation of language models when fine-tuned on new languages. In the second part, I will introduce ongoing work on continually adapting multilingual language models to new languages. This work investigates how effectively models can be extended to languages with varying levels of resources and linguistic relatedness while preserving performance on previously supported languages. We study the trade-offs between adaptation efficiency, catastrophic forgetting, and cross-lingual generalization, providing insights into practical strategies for real-world multilingual NLP.

  title: Cultural Bias and Privacy Protection in Large Language Models
  abstract: |
    In this talk, I will explore two key aspects of large language models (LLMs) and their pre-training data: cultural bias and privacy preservation. First, I will present a systematic study on LLMs' favoritism toward Western culture. Our approach involves curating a dataset of over 20,000 cultural items, including food, clothing, individuals, religious sites, and more, to contrast Arabic and Western cultures. We assess cultural biases across multilingual LLMs (e.g., GPT-4, Aya) through natural prompts, story generation, sentiment analysis, and named entity recognition (NER) tasks. A key finding suggests heavy reliance on Wikipedia data during pre-training may have contributed to the bias toward Western concepts in non-Western languages. 
    <br><br>
    Next, I will showcase PrivacyMirror, an LLM-powered tool designed to help users safeguard their personal information. Leveraging insights from an HCI study with real Reddit users, PrivacyMirror reveals challenges and opportunities which shape ongoing efforts to enhance user-centric privacy protection. 
    <br><br>
    To conclude, I will briefly discuss recent research on the temporal robustness of LLMs, particularly their ability to handle neologisms, and advances in human-AI interactive evaluation.
