  title: Planning in Creative Contexts
  abstract: Recent modeling innovations incorporate planning — or reasoning about actions and future states, exhibited by models like GPT-o1 and Deepseek's R1 — and have demonstrated impressive performance gains in areas like mathematical problem-solving and computer coding. However, such domains are characterized by well-defined goals (or rewards); for many human-centered creative tasks, rewards are not as clearly defined and it is thus not clear how current planning approaches can transfer. In this talk, I will outline a research agenda that can enable us to make progress in these areas. I focus on tasks related to journalism, with specific focus on retrieving a set of sources relevant to a news story. I will show how we can make inferences about human actions based on limited state-observations (a process known to cognitive psychologists as "emulation", but as yet unexplored in machine learning) and how these inferences can help us learn human values and rewards.
