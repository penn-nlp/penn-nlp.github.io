  title: "OLMo: Accelerating the Science of Open Language Models"
  abstract: "Recently, we have seen tremendous progress in the field of language models (LMs), with the release of numerous open models and closed API systems. However, fewer and fewer disclose how they are created: Which corpora do they use? How are they trained? How much energy do they consume? In this talk, I will provide an overview of OLMo (https://allenai.org/olmo), an initiative at Ai2 aimed at creating transparent artifacts and tools that advance the science of LMs. I will discuss current and upcoming releases, such as Tulu, Dolma, OLMo, OLMoE, as well as the goals and ethical/legal considerations of this initiative."

  title: "A More Natural and Complex Question Answering Benchmark"
  abstract: "An important and highly useful application of large language models is answering information-seeking questions. Ideally, an evaluation benchmark for this task should include natural questions that reflect real-world users' goals. However, existing QA benchmarks contain questions that are either natural but simple (answer lies in a single sentence) or complex questions that are machine generated and are often contrived. To address this gap we introduce MONACO, a new benchmark of More Natural and Complex QA. The questions in MONACO are all manually written and express a diverse set of user goals. In terms of complexity, MONACO questions require aggregating information from 34 documents on average -- more than double that of previous list QA tasks. Overall, we collected over 1,800 multi-step, 8,000 list and 110,000 single step natural questions complete with answers and document attributions. We use MONACO to benchmark the performance of the top performing LLMs and explore the strengths and pitfalls of popular prompting techniques like chain-of-thought and decomposed prompting."

  title: "Towards a science of human-AI teams"
  abstract: "AI models have the potential to support and complement human decision-makers and users. And yet, the deployment of human-AI teams still faces practical challenges. I’m interested in developing a more principled workflow for building human-AI teams. In particular, this talk will focus on answering two questions: (1) what the right evaluation paradigms are to measure team performance and (2) what are interaction mechanisms that can facilitate the appropriate usage of AI support. I will discuss how existing ML/NLP literature has attempted to answer each of these questions, their limitations, and promising alternatives."

  title: "Collecting and Learning from Human Feedback"
  abstract: "Human Feedback has emerged as an important ingredient to align large language models. However, it is challenging to both collect high quality human feedback, and ensure that reward models trained on this feedback capture the right axes of preferences. In this talk, I will present our work on developing a robust pipeline for data collection that improves agreement. I will further describe a thrust of our work that investigates a peculiar phenomenon that occurs when training language models with human feedback: model outputs are substantially longer. Our work shows that performance improvements after RLHF are largely due to increased length, instead of other important features. We test a comprehensive set of length-countering interventions, and identify reward models as the dominance source of this bias."

  title: "Instruction Following without Instruction Tuning"
  abstract: "This talk is about a few curious results on what makes language models follow instructions. When we want a language model to follow instructions, we often finetune it on instruction-response pairs and hope it generalizes -- this is (explicit) instruction tuning. I'll discuss _implicit instruction tuning_ -- we discovered that sometimes, when we finetune a language model on an objective that seems deficient compared to instruction tuning, the resulting finetuned model follows instructions anyway. This happens when we train a model to predict responses without conditioning on instructions (response tuning), and when we train only on a single task (like generating only poetry, or only recipes.) To dig into why implicit instruction tuning seems so common, I'll make concrete how simple it is to make a language model follow instructions by showing how to with a rule-based helper. As a takeaway: when you adapt a language model for a specific task, it's possible that it might (surprisingly?) act as a general-purpose chatbot for highly dissimilar inputs."

  title: "The Enigma of LLMs: on Creativity, Compositionality, and Paradoxes"

  title: "AppWorld: Reliable Evaluation of Interactive Agents in a World of Apps and People"
  abstract: "We envision a world where AI agents (assistants) are widely used for complex tasks in our digital and physical worlds and are broadly integrated into our society. To move towards such a future, we need an environment for a robust evaluation of agents' capability, reliability, and trustworthiness. In this talk, I’ll introduce AppWorld, which is a step towards this goal in the context of day-to-day digital tasks. AppWorld is a high-fidelity simulated world of people and their digital activities on nine apps like Amazon, Gmail, and Venmo. On top of this fully controllable world, we build a benchmark of complex day-to-day tasks such as splitting Venmo bills with roommates, which agents have to solve via interactive coding and API calls. One of the fundamental challenges with complex tasks lies in accounting for different ways in which the tasks can be completed. I will describe how we address this challenge using a reliable and programmatic evaluation framework. Our benchmarking evaluations show that even the best LLMs, like GPT-4o, can only solve ~30% of such tasks, highlighting the challenging nature of the AppWorld benchmark. I will conclude by laying out exciting future research that can be conducted on the foundation of AppWorld, such as benchmarks and playground for developing multimodal, collaborative, safe, socially intelligent, resourceful, and fail-tolerant agents."

  title: "Takeaways from the SCALE 2024 Workshop on Video-based Event Retrieval"
  abstract: "Information dissemination for current events has traditionally consisted of professionally collected and produced materials, leading to large collections of well-written news articles and high-quality videos. As a result, most prior work in event analysis and retrieval has focused on leveraging this traditional news content, particularly in English. However, much of the event-centric content today is generated by non-professionals, such as on-the-scene witnesses to events who hastily capture videos and upload them to the internet without further editing; these are challenging to find due to quality variance, as well as a lack of text or speech overlays providing clear descriptions of what is occurring. To address this gap, SCALE 2024, a 10-week research workshop hosted at the Human Language Technology Center of Excellence (HLTCOE), focused on multilingual event-centric video retrieval, or the task of finding relevant videos about specific current events. Around 50 researchers and students participated in this workshop and were split up into five sub-teams. The Infrastructure team focused on developing MultiVENT 2.0, a challenging video retrieval dataset consisting of 20x more videos than prior work and targeted queries about specific world events across six languages. Other teams worked on improving models from specific modalities, specifically Vision, Optical Character Recognition (OCR), Audio, and Text. Overall, we came away with three primary findings: extracting specific text from a video allows us to take better advantage of powerful methods from the text information retrieval community; LLM summarization of initial text outputs from videos is helpful, especially for noisy text coming from OCR; and no one modality is sufficient, with fusing outputs from all modalities resulting in significantly higher performance."

  title: "DataDreamer: Synthetic Data Generation and Reproducible LLM Workflows"
  abstract: "Large language models (LLMs) have become an essential tool for NLP researchers in a wide range of tasks. Many now rely on LLMs for synthetic data generation, task evaluation, fine-tuning, and other model-in-the-loop workflows. However, challenges arise due to their scale, closed-source nature, and the lack of standardized tooling, which can hinder open science and reproducibility. In this talk, we present DataDreamer, an open-source Python library designed to help researchers implement LLM workflows more easily. DataDreamer also promotes best practices that support open science and improve reproducibility in research."

  title: "Advancing Multimodal AI: Integrating Modalities, Tackling Complex Challenges, and Enhancing Interpretability"
  abstract: "Advancing AI systems that understand and integrate multiple modalities—such as images, language, audio, video, and 3D—has significant implications for real-world applications. A major challenge lies in developing AI models that can efficiently process diverse modalities while providing transparent and interpretable decision-making. This talk will highlight recent contributions, including X-InstructBLIP, a framework for aligning multimodal representations with language models for cross-modal reasoning; studies on bistable images that reveal how AI models interpret visual ambiguity; and ongoing work on visual unit testing to ensure robust, and interpretable multimodal reasoning."

  title: "Better Evaluations for Multimodal Generative Models"
  abstract: "Multimodal generative models such as GPT-4o and DALL-E 3 are being developed at a rapid pace. While these models have incredible new abilities, we still mostly follow the same old paradigms when it comes to evaluating the language or images that these models produce. Consequently, these models' potential is constrained by outdated evaluation criteria. In this talk, we will introduce two new benchmarks: (1) BLINK, designed to assess core visual perception abilities that are not addressed by existing benchmarks for multimodal large language models; and (2) Commonsense-T2I, which tests whether the generated images align with real-life commonsense. Our findings show that current multimodal generative models perform significantly worse than humans on both benchmarks, highlighting potential pathways for future improvements."

  title: "Can LLMs Reason and Plan?"
  abstract: "Large Language Models (LLMs) are on track to reverse what seemed like an inexorable shift of AI from explicit to tacit knowledge tasks. Trained as they are on everything ever written on the web, LLMs exhibit “approximate omniscience”–they can provide answers to all sorts of queries, but with nary a guarantee. This could herald a new era for knowledge-based AI systems–with LLMs taking the role of (blowhard?) experts. But first, we have to stop confusing the impressive style/form of the generated knowledge for correct/factual content, and resist the temptation to ascribe reasoning, planning, self-critiquing etc. powers to approximate retrieval by these n-gram models on steroids. We have to focus instead on LLM-Modulo techniques that complement the unfettered idea generation of LLMs with careful vetting by model-based verifiers (the models underlying which themselves can be teased out from LLMs in semi-automated fashion). In this talk, I will reify this vision and attendant caveats in the context of our ongoing work on understanding the role of LLMs in planning tasks."
