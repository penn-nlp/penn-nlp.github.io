  title: Enforcing Abstraction with Artificial Bottlenecks for Complex Machine Reasoning
  abstract: "Human reasoning comes from trial and error on an abstract level: we learn from past experiences, conceptualize atomic operations and notions, and recompose them in new situations and scenarios. Such abstraction and conceptualization are the key sources of generalization. On the other hand, recent successes in machine reasoning are primarily from end-to-end training (e.g., next-word prediction and task-specific supervision), where models tend to rely more on memorization than generalization. Such observations motivate us to encourage models to perform high-level abstractions when learning. In this talk, I will discuss my recent works and methods that force model abstractions with artificial bottlenecks, where we deliberately remove essential information from the reasoning process so that models have to reason abstractively, similar to how computer programs conceptualize input values with variables and operations. These works show promising future research directions of model generalization and trustworthiness."
