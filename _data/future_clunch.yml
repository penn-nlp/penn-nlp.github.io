  title: "What ails multi-step reasoning and how to fix it."
  abstract: 'Multi-step reasoning has seen much empirical progress on many datasets recently, especially in Question Answering. However, training and evaluating on typical crowdsourced datasets is problematic because of the potential for shortcut reasoning based on artifacts. What can we do about this? In this three part talk, I will first show how we can formalize and measure disconnected reasoning, a type of bad multihop reasoning. I will then discuss how we can construct new datasets using a bottom-up construction process,  which allows us to better control for desired properties in the resulting dataset. In the third part, I will briefly present how synthetically generated data can be used to teach a broad range of multihop skills in a reliable manner and how to improve reliable multi-step reasoning in open-domain QA settings.'
