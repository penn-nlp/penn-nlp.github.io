  title: "Towards Artificial Social Intelligence: Grounded Social Reasoning in Multimodal Models"
  abstract: |
    Advancing social intelligence in AI systems is important for these systems to effectively navigate human social interactions and work <em>with</em> and <em>around</em> humans. This talk will focus on grounded social reasoning abilities of multimodal models. I will discuss Social Genome, a modeling challenge that tests the abilities of multimodal models to reason about human social interactions, by interpreting and integrating embodied multimodal communicative behaviors and external social knowledge. I will also discuss core technical challenges and opportunities to advance artificial social intelligence, with perspectives anchored in social intelligence concepts and prior research from several computing communities.
